# Helix Jump
This project is an attempt at recreating Helix Jump by VOODOO.  
It was done in 3.5 hours as a class exercise.  

## Features
This game has a basic ball controller that bounces and rotates around a central pillar.  
You can play through 3 different levels before going back to the menu.  
Every level is randomly generated (even when the ball dies).  
The randomness was supposed to be balanced but it is not really the case.

## Limitations
You do not have information on the current level's progression.  
The menu does not have a quit button, therefore no build is distributed for this project.

## Known Issues
Occasionally, that the level is not correctly cleared when you lose,  
so the level may be recreated a second time on top of the previous one, thus making it  
sometimes impossible to beat.
